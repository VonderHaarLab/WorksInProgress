# Development of a touchscreen to assess pig behaviors

## This repository includes materials related to an upcoming publication describing the construction and operation of a touchscreen device for testing various pig behaviors

The preprint of the publication can be found on [bioRxiv](LINK)

A set of three videos are supplemental material showing the [first version](LINK) of the device which was ultimately damaged by the pigs, [nose-poke training](LINK) on the second version, and a [discrimination task](LINK) on the second version.

A program written in python was used to train pigs to interact with the device and [is provided](LINK) in this repository. It has a non-commercial use license which allows free use, modification, and distribution for non-commercial purposes.

The files to create the PCB used to interface the Raspberry Pi to external pieces are [also included](LINK).

## Once published, this directory will be moved to Published Works and updates to the published project will be provided here.
