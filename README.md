## [Pig Behavioral Testing with a Touchscreen](<Pig Behavior Testing Touchscreen>)
This repository contains a description of materials to create a touchscreen which can be used to train pigs to perform various behavioral tests. This has relevance for many different disease models which use pigs, including brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.
This will be updated periodically with improvements to hardware, software, or design of behavioral tasks. Collaborative requests are encouraged!
